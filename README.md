# Python Steak Week: Adote

Python Steak Week, it was a week of a lot of learning and practical understanding about Django building a complete application with backend and frontend. We built a pet registration and request system. We use Python 3, Django, SQLite, Html, and CSS.

I was able to understand how the MVT works in practice, understanding how the Models represent the data in the database using Django's native ORM, how the Views are used to serve as a request receiver and return responses and I understand how the Template, where the local that the application model is generated using the artifacts contained by the web browser. This is the part responsible for everything the user can see.
